I am currently exploring the key factors affecting AI-related Ph.D. admissions, especially given 1. the field's rapid expansion and growing volume of research; 2. the inevitable gap between the academic research and industry needs; 3. the post-pandemic international situation. I expect this research to be both qualitative and quantitative, gathering some insights for understanding the dynamics.

This is a personal project, completely driven by curiosity without any funding or public support. If you are AI-related professors/researchers/students, I would be very grateful if you could spare 15~30 minutes for a conversation.

The conversation will be complete confidential. And if you are interested, I would be happy to keep you updated on the progress and findings of the project, which could offer a broader view of current trends in Ph.D. admissions.

Thank you so much for your help!
