Some key questions:

1. Why do we need agents? (For research rather than industrial needs)

2. Why do we need Multi-agent Debate? (The goods and bads). Under what conditions does it perform better or worse?

3. How can we model the debate structure and integrate it effectively within agent collaboration?

4. What are other potential applications or implications? (e.g. simulate bias origination and transmission in human societies, and gain insights for fields like Social Anthropology and Social Psychology)

I'll try to answer them when I'm ready.
