>[!warning] To Start...

For me, a particular research direction isn't solely about passion; it's more like a jobâ€”something I don't need to deeply love, but simply need to complete. But what drives me here? The interest of research lies in the research itself. The specific field or topic is secondary; what matters most is the research itself[^1].

[^1]: Well... If the tasks require extensive hands-on practice with mechanical operations like cutting or welding, I must admit it's not really my thing. I've tried them in class before, but I usually need about 1.5 times longer than others to complete them. After reflecting on this, I think the reason is that these classes often demand immediate manual execution. For each step, I tend to take a bit more time to fully understand the procedure, its purpose, and even take notes, but these kinds of practical courses typically expect quick hands-on replication without too much hesitation.
