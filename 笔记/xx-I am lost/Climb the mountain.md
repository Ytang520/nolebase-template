Living is like climbing a snowy mountain. When you look ahead, all you see is endless white with no end in sight. When you look back, the snow covers your tracks, leaving nothing behind. If you stay put, you feel your feet growing cold. Yet, when you look down, the small footprints in the snow somehow give you a bit of confidence.

I've often asked myself, why live? What's the purpose of living?

Life is like a flower. I strive to open the flower of my life and help others open theirs. That's the answer I found after asking my soul.

And what happens after it blooms? I guess we’ll find out once it reaches that point—I’m not sure if I’ll ever fully see it open in my lifetime.
