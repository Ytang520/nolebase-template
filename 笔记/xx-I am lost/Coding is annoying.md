For the past five days, I’ve been debugging from early morning until midnight, only to make no progress at all.

I’m completely drained.

My head feels foggy. Over the last four months, I’ve been getting less than six hours of sleep each night—far less than I used to. I can feel my memory getting worse and worse...

Once this phase is over, I’ll take the time to seriously study computer-related topics. Or maybe I’ll just walk away from these code-heavy tasks altogether.

Sigh... I have to head to work now, or I’ll just get chewed out again tomorrow.

OK, not that annoying... esp. when I gave up that repository and switched to a different one for replication. This new setup feels almost too straightforward.

God bless to me, it's not (entirely) my fault. What a relief.
