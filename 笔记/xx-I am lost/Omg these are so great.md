I recently read/watched some incredible works (at least they touch me right now), and I can’t help but fall in love with them… seriously, you (and future me) *have* to check them out!

Later I'll write some comments on them.

- **Kirishima Miyama** (from Yakuza Fiancé: Raise wa Tanin ga Ii).

- **Everything, everywhere all at once**. (EEAAO)
I laughed and cried while watching it, just like when I was watching *Fleabag*. I can’t relate to many so-called 'masterpieces,' but this one truly speaks to me. The faults I've done, the pains I've swallowed and the sorrows I've brought are too heavy to carry. I have to ignore them to keep my heart safe, even it is not sound.

I was tired, too, several months ago. My parents are so kind—too kind—that I can’t bring myself to ask for their support. They would come to see me and protect me at all their cost, which I can't burden anymore. I've hurt so many people, that sometimes I feel that all I've done before are totally wrong.

Finally I figure out (maybe it's wrong too) that just don't expect from myself, not a little thing. Let the life leads me to where I will be, and I watch it, and then I die.

Please... don't expect too much from me. Just let me ... go...

- **Agatha All Along**

- **Sylus**
Oh... Sylus is hot, and incredible...and hot. I love him so so so much!!!
