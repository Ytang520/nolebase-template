[^1]: 我对写代码说不上喜欢也说不上讨厌，代码不会和人虚与委蛇，每天 写代码debug 的时候内心都很平静，常常不知不觉一天过去了，也同样的，即便有些成果，除了看电脑久了有些头晕外也没有任何感受。可我不擅长写代码，非计算机科班出身，很多基础自己摸索着学习，学了忘，忘了学，不成体系。不过好在是做 ML，网上有太多人踩坑又爬出来，总有人出过类似的错误；再然后出现了GPT，算是福音。如果有人问我没有 GPT我还会不会做 AI 研究，答案八成是 No —— 相比于人工智能，我还是更喜欢分析数学。只是我可能再也没有机会了。当初的一念之差，变成了如今这个模样，真是......不知道该说什么好.....



I can’t say I like or dislike coding. Code doesn’t involve pretenses. If they are wrong, they are wrong. Every day, as I write and debug, I feel a sense of calm. Often, before I realize it, the entire day has slipped away. But, even when I achieve something, the only noticeable effect is a bit of dizziness from staring at the screen too long—nothing more.

But truth be told, I'm not good at coding. I didn’t major in computer science, so I’ve had to teach myself many of the basics. Pains and suffering comes from constantly learning and forgetting, then relearning again, never quite building a foundation. Fortunately, in the field of ML, countless people have documented their journey online, so there’s always someone who’s faced similar trouble. And then came GPT, which has been nothing short of a blessing.

If someone were to ask me whether I would still pursue AI research without GPT, my answer would probably be no. Compared to AI, my true passion lies in what some might call "useless and flashy" mathematical analysis, once spoken by one of the professors with "you’re not worthy."
